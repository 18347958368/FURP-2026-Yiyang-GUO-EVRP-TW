# Local Research Environment

This repository uses a native Apple Silicon environment for reproducing
Schneider, Stenger, and Goeke (2014).

## Installed stack

- Python 3.13.13 managed by `uv` in `.venv`
- C++20 compiled by Apple Clang
- CMake and Ninja for native builds
- pybind11/scikit-build-core for the Python-to-C++ extension
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, NetworkX, Numba, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and JupyterLab
- OR-Tools and HiGHS as open-source fallback solvers
- IBM CPLEX 22.2 Python runtime and DOcplex
- Gurobi 13.0 Python runtime
- pytest, coverage, Ruff, and mypy development tools for future verification

Python 3.13.14 was requested initially, but no `uv` ARM64 build was available on
2026-06-14. The project therefore pins the latest available 3.13 patch release,
3.13.13, and deliberately does not use the system Python 3.14 installation.

## Bootstrap

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
uv run evrptw-env
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv`, resolves `uv.lock`, builds the C++ extension, and
installs all Python dependencies.

## Solver licenses

The solver Python packages are installed, but meaningful benchmark models
require unrestricted academic licences.

1. Request IBM CPLEX through the
   [IBM Academic Initiative](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/pricing).
   Install the macOS ARM64 edition and upgrade the Python runtime with:

   ```bash
   uv run docplex config --upgrade /path/to/CPLEX_Studio
   ```

2. Request a free
   [Gurobi Academic License](https://www.gurobi.com/academics). For a single Mac,
   use a Named-User license and run the `grbgetkey` command supplied by the
   Gurobi portal. Academic verification in China may require the
   [manual application route](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/33982552193937-As-a-student-at-a-university-in-China-how-do-I-request-a-Free-Academic-License).

Do not commit license files, account tokens, or solver credentials.

## Experiment profiles

- `configs/reproduction.toml`: CPLEX, one thread, seed 2014, ten repetitions,
  and the paper's 7,200-second exact-solver limit.
- `configs/performance.toml`: Gurobi primary, CPLEX cross-check, and all locally
  available CPU threads.

The paper comparison must use the reproduction profile. Performance-profile
results should be reported separately because they are not hardware-equivalent
to the original Intel i5/4GB/Windows 7 experiments.

## Benchmark data

Download the public Schneider instances from
<https://doi.org/10.17632/h3mrm5dhxw.1> and place them under
`data/schneider/`. The repository ignores `data/` so the dataset is never
uploaded accidentally.

Parse and validate an instance in Python:

```python
from evrptw import parse_schneider, validate_routes

instance = parse_schneider("data/schneider/c101C5.txt")
report = validate_routes(instance, [["D0", "C1", "S0", "D0"]])
print(report.feasible, report.total_distance)
```

## Reproducibility records

Write machine-readable environment metadata next to an experiment:

```bash
uv run evrptw-env --output results/runs/environment.json
```

The report records the OS, architecture, CPU count, Python executable, package
versions, compiler/build tools, and C++ extension. Generated files under
`results/` are ignored by Git.
