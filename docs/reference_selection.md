## Why this paper was selected

1. **Exact topic match.** The paper introduces the Electric Vehicle-Routing
   Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations (E-VRPTW), which directly
   matches this repository's research topic.
2. **Strong research venue.** INFORMS describes *Transportation Science* as the
   flagship journal of its Transportation Science and Logistics Society and a
   foremost journal for transportation analysis.
3. **Strong institutional background.** The first author was affiliated with
   Technical University of Darmstadt when the paper was published. TU Darmstadt
   is a member of TU9, the alliance of Germany's leading universities of
   technology.
4. **High research impact.** Semantic Scholar reported 1,240 citations and
   OpenAlex reported 1,234 citations when checked on 2026-06-14. Citation counts
   vary by database and will change over time.
5. **Reproducibility.** The authors introduced public benchmark instances. The
   paper includes a mixed-integer linear programming formulation and a hybrid
   Variable Neighborhood Search/Tabu Search method, allowing both small-instance
   validation and heuristic experiments on larger instances.

## Shortlisted alternatives

Citation counts below are Semantic Scholar values checked on 2026-06-14. They
are included for comparison, not as permanent metrics.

| Paper | Year | Approx. citations | Reason not selected as the primary paper |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| [The Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.01.038) | 2016 | 569 | Strong and influential, but adds fleet-size and fleet-mix decisions beyond the repository's current core scope. |
| [Partial recharge strategies for the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.013) | 2016 | 539 | Highly relevant extension, but it builds on the Schneider benchmark and is better treated as an innovation reference. |
| [The electric vehicle routing problem with nonlinear charging function](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2017.02.004) | 2017 | 517 | Important realistic charging extension, but nonlinear charging raises implementation complexity for an initial replication. |
| [Exact Algorithms for Electric Vehicle-Routing Problems with Time Windows](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1535) | 2016 | 470 | Excellent institutions and journal, but its exact branch-price-and-cut style methods are substantially harder to reproduce in an undergraduate project. |

## Initial replication boundary

The first milestone should reproduce the selected paper's problem definition,
feasibility constraints, hierarchical objectives, benchmark parser, and results
on small instances. The larger-instance VNS/TS baseline can then be implemented
and validated before adding the required innovation.

The publisher-formatted version is not stored because it is not marked as open
access. A publicly accessible pre-publication technical-report version and four
supporting reference PDFs are kept in the project's local literature folder
outside Git. The local `document/literature` shortcut is excluded by
`.gitignore`.
